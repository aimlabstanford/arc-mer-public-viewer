Firearm access can also pose injury risks for older adults with declining physical or cognitive abilities, but little is known about how older adults make decisions about \u201cfirearm retirement.\u201d Through this proposal, we will improve understanding of stakeholder views about firearm retirement, in general and particular contexts (likely onset of dementia or other significant illness or loss), to inform our development of prototypes of culturally competent guidelines and resources for intervention.",

Videos will present how uncontrolled donation after circulatory determination of death (uDCDD) programs that consider candidates for donation no matter timing or location of death, so long as consideration occurs after all life sustaining efforts are exhausted, are promising means for solving the organ donation crisis for Latinos, a population with disproportionally greater need.

This proposal thus has the potential to reduce race/ethnicity-related RRA, strengthen workforce training by improving provider competency for resolving race and ethnicity-related aggression among residents, and benefit residents with ADRD from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds who are at higher risk of RRA involvement due cognitive impairment related behavioral symptoms.",

Polypharmacy is associated with adverse outcomes including receiving less chemotherapy, which in turn can affect cancer-related survival. \u201cDeprescribing,\u201d or the planned discontinuation of medications, is an intervention that can address polypharmacy, but it has not been studied in older adults with cancer receiving curative-chemotherapy; this proposal refines and tests two deprescribing intervention strategies in these patients.",

We will study the mechanisms that link abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, and chronic kidney disease. It will also evaluate a low-cost strategy that relies on lay health workers to screen for kidney disease among patients with diabetes and to motivate them to seek care. The strategy will have applicability not only in low- and middle- income countries, but also in the U.S. where non-physician health care workers are increasingly becoming a part of the team caring for patients with chronic diseases.",

We will study the mechanisms that link abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, and chronic kidney disease. It will also evaluate a low-cost strategy that relies on lay health workers to screen for kidney disease among patients with diabetes and to motivate them to seek care. The strategy will have applicability not only in low- and middle- income countries, but also in the U.S. where non-physician health care workers are increasingly becoming a part of the team caring for patients with chronic diseases.

We created an app called GeriKit, which can be used on a mobile phone or tablet computer, to make it easier for clinicians to measure these impairments. In the proposed study we will evaluate whether GeriKit can be used to predict what happens to patients, and also add new instruments to improve the app, all of which will provide new opportunities for junior scientists who are focused on aging research.",

At the same time, the fastest growing segment of the population is precisely this group at greatest risk. According to the World Health Organization, the number of people worldwide aged 80 years and older will quadruple between 2000 and 2050; this population is sometimes referred to as the \"oldest old\", and has historically been under- represented in osteoporosis studies. At age 50 years, a woman in the U.S. has approximately a 1 in 2 and a man has a 1 in 4 chance of experiencing a major fracture in their remaining lifetime. A majority of osteoporotic fractures occur after a low trauma fall, with 1 in 3 adults over age 65 years falling experiencing at least 1 fall annually, and 1 in every 10-12 falls resulting in a fracture. Thus, fall and fracture prevention in olde...",

NIDDK has supported efforts by the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) from 2012 through 2023 through the R25 mechanism. I have been involved in these efforts for decades at the local (UCSD) and national levels. The latest of these R25 DK118761 AGA - Fostering Opportunities Resulting in Workforce and Research Diversity (FORWARD) provides a structured mentoring program for junior GI faculty. The program has provided structured mentoring to 20 junior academic GI\u2019s and has received an excellent score for the next 5-year cycle renewal. I have been involved in these efforts for decades at the local (UCSD) and national levels. This award will provide dedicated salary support to allow this investigator to reallocate effort to these diversity initiatives both at UCSD and with the AGA.",

Building on our pilot work to generate an electronic frailty index (eFI) in the electronic medical record for older adults, we will adapt and refine an eFI, using already existing data from patients served by primary care practices in our partner Next Generation Accountable Care Organization. We will then test whether primary care providers (a) find value in the eFI when caring for frail and at-risk older adults, (b) change their medical advice and support based on the eFI score, and (c) whether this change improves health outcomes for older adults as a consequence.",

A significant functional decline following hip fracture has been documented, and many patients have persistent strength and mobility deficits that impair their ability to live independently. The overall goals of the proposed project are to evaluate, in elderly female hip fracture patients, the benefits of short-term testosterone therapy combined with supervised exercise, on mobility and quality of life during the year following the fracture, which is a problem with a large public health impact.",

New approaches that can be offered acutely to the majority of ischemic stroke patients, and continued throughout the duration of post-stroke care, can limit stroke severity, can complement or even enhance rehabilitation, and could transform ischemic stroke recovery. The treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among patients with acute ischemic stroke represents one such novel therapeutic approach; thus, the Recovery In Stroke Using PAP (RISE-UP) study is a randomized controlled trial over 6 months among patients with acute ischemic stroke to determine if sleep apnea treatment improves functional and symptoms outcomes in these patients.",

We will also test whether the intervention improves civility, decreases rates of microaggressions and sexual harassment, and leads to a greater sense of belonging, well-being, research productivity, and persistence in a biomedical research career among NIH T32 mentees.",

New approaches that can be offered acutely to the majority of ischemic stroke patients, and continued throughout the duration of post-stroke care, can limit stroke severity, can complement or even enhance rehabilitation, and could transform ischemic stroke recovery. The treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among patients with acute ischemic stroke represents one such novel therapeutic approach; thus, the Recovery In Stroke Using PAP (RISE-UP) study is a randomized controlled trial over 6 months among patients with acute ischemic stroke to determine if sleep apnea treatment improves functional and symptoms outcomes in these patients.",

Key outcomes will be measured before and after treatment (1 month) and again at 3-months follow-up (main outcome time point), and the results of this study will have significant clinical implications, regardless of the findings, by informing future patient-centered studies and interventions.",

Early evidence suggests that a recovery program that incudes both physical and cognitive training may reduce the impact of post-ICU cognitive impairment.

New approaches that can be offered acutely to the majority of ischemic stroke patients, and continued throughout the duration of post-stroke care, can limit stroke severity, can complement or even enhance rehabilitation, and could transform ischemic stroke recovery. The treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among patients with acute ischemic stroke represents one such novel therapeutic approach; thus, the Recovery In Stroke Using PAP (RISE-UP) study is a randomized controlled trial over 6 months among patients with acute ischemic stroke to determine if sleep apnea treatment improves functional and symptoms outcomes in these patients.",

PAH is very rare with an annual incidence of 1 to 2 per million and occurs more often in women. While a certain fraction of patients have been found to have a hereditary predisposition to the disease, the cause remains unknown. Recent treatment advances have shown some benefit, but the disease has no cure. This project will provide a network of investigators to enroll patients who, at the time of lung transplantation, will donate their tissue and cells for future research. Completion of this work should aid in the development of newer diagnostic tests and more effective treatments. (End of Abstract)",

PAH is very rare with an annual incidence of 1 to 2 per million and occurs more often in women. While a certain fraction of patients have been found to have a hereditary predisposition to the disease, the cause remains unknown. Recent treatment advances have shown some benefit, but the disease has no cure. This project will provide a network of investigators to enroll patients who, at the time of lung transplantation, will donate their tissue and cells for future research. Completion of this work should aid in the development of newer diagnostic tests and more effective treatments. (End of Abstract)                    ",

The goal of this R25 program is to increase the numbers of minorities pursuing careers in cardiovascular medical research by providing undergraduate underrepresented minority (URM) students with a short-term mentored research experience in the laboratories of Stanford Medicine\u2019s Cardiovascular Institute. Participation in mentored research increases the degree to which undergraduate URM students identify as scientists, which in turn increases the likelihood that URM students persist in research careers.",

The purpose of this application is to renew support for the successful Short- Term Aging-related Research (STAR) T-35 program which has been providing summer training in basic, clinical, and social science research for Pritzker medical students to inspire and prepare them to pursue careers in aging research for the past 10 years. At graduation, our NIH T35 trainees are more likely to be an author on a research publication, be satisfied with research experiences in medical school, state that research enhanced their career goals, and 3 times more likely to report intention to pursue an academic full-time research career. The proposed program will continue to be led by Dr. ...",

We will integrate core social and behavioral methods within existing curriculum, expand learning opportunities by offering new annual training workshops and monthly lectures focused on evaluation and implementation science for our TL1 Master's in Science in Clinical Research and Certificate Program in Translational Research trainees, and expand an existing network for evaluation and implementation sciences to include all four Georgia CTSA institutions. We hypothesize that such new training will lead to rigorous new clinical and translational research in applied social and behavioral sciences.",

Were empirically validated/effective interventions (like the painTRAINER Internet- based coping skills training program) translated into a culturally appropriate Spanish language iteration and made broadly available, they undoubtedly would enhance access to and engagement in pain management programs amongst this marginalized population of patients. In collaboration with Hispanic and Latinx community organizations, community advisory boards, patient advocates, and oncology experts, we will follow a carefully designed community-engaged translation methodology to generate a new version of painTRAINER in the Spanish language that is both linguistically and culturally sensitive, and will establish the feasibility and acceptability of the newly ge...",

The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that mechanical ventilation causes pulmonary cells to release vesicles that penetrate the brain and induce brain cell death. If we can understand what is causing brain cell death in mechanically ventilated preterm newborns, we may be able to develop therapeutic strategies to improve the neurodevelopmental outcomes of these vulnerable infants.",

We found that patients with SCD and pain had low levels of the amino acid arginine in their blood, and we also demonstrated that arginine supplementation during acute pain events significantly reduced the amount of opioids needed to treat sickle cell pain in children and dramatically improved pain scores at discharge compared to placebo. We propose to investigate the benefits and safety of arginine for the treatment of patients with SCD and pain in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial where neither the patient nor the clinical team know which therapy the patient is receiving, since Arginine is a promising nutritional therapy that could change the way we treat acute pain in SCD.",

We therefore propose a cluster randomized trial to test implementation and effectiveness of \"high touch\" and \"low touch\" strategies to sign up mothers into the TodaysBabyTM program at 20 US hospitals in counties with high rates of SUID; this study will inform wide-scale dissemination of TodaysBabyTM, and subsequent adherence to safe sleep practices and reduction of SUID in communities with historically high SUID rates.",

The overall purpose of the proposed study is to test, through a 4- armed pragmatic randomized controlled trial, an intervention strategy, grounded in health behavior theory, which uses online social networks to disseminate evidence-based information in an attempt to change social norms regarding infant sleep and breastfeeding. We anticipate that impacting the social network and norms will lead to improvements in safe sleep and breastfeeding practices, which in turn may lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of sleep-related deaths, particularly in Black infants.",

The overall purpose of the proposed study is to test, through a 4- armed pragmatic randomized controlled trial, an intervention strategy, grounded in health behavior theory, which uses online social networks to disseminate evidence-based information in an attempt to change social norms regarding infant sleep and breastfeeding. We anticipate that impacting the social network and norms will lead to improvements in safe sleep and breastfeeding practices, which in turn may lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of sleep-related deaths, particularly in Black infants.",

The proposed project will adapt and test a comprehensive, on-line, parent-mediated, free intervention (OPT-In- Early Bilingual Latinx Version) for Latinx families in the US; it can be used during these wait times and supplement professional intervention. Results of this study will lead to a large-scale test of this intervention, with the goal of making it freely available to Latinx families and optimizing their children's development.",

Children have not been spared, and the lack of adequate physical activity in youth will impact health across the lifespan. This research is designed to use the most advance research techniques to gain a better understanding of exactly how exercise can benefit health. This information will then be used to design effective programs that use exercise to benefit healthy children and to address specific needs in children with chronic disease and disability.",

Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of weight management but often is insufficient, so anti-obesity medication is recommended as a next step. However, there may be concerns from teens, parents, and pediatricians on using these types of medication given the history of some being pulled off the market due to severe side effects. Understanding teens, their parents and pediatricians\u2019 views will be important for successful adoption of these medications.",

Bioethics education has been shown to illuminate unconscious biases and alleviate moral distress in other fraught clinical contexts. We will develop a novel, interactive bioethics training module using examples from real clinical practice to help healthcare providers navigate moral distress and reduce barriers to expansion and sustainment of ELT.",

The proposed study seeks to adapt and enhance sustainability of proven educational and quality improvement interventions to target multiple health systems\u2013 dialysis facilities and transplant centers \u2013 as well as clinical staff and patients in the Southeastern United States to target the policies, practices, and structures of these health systems that pose barriers to underrepresented minorities with end-stage kidney failure seeking a kidney transplant. If successful, interventions could be adapted and scaled nationally, where our health system partners are committed to transplant equity.",
